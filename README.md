# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Overview

This project involves building a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The goal is to accurately estimate property values using these key factors. This project was completed as part of an internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

## Features

- **Square Footage**: The size of the house in square feet.
- **Number of Bedrooms**: Total number of bedrooms in the house.
- **Number of Bathrooms**: Total number of bathrooms in the house.
- **Other Features**: Additional features may include the age of the property, location, etc.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for developing the model.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For building and evaluating the Linear Regression model.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
    cd house-price-prediction
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**:
    - Load the dataset using Pandas.
    - Perform data cleaning and preprocessing as required.
    
2. **Feature Selection**:
    - Identify and select key features that influence house prices.

3. **Model Building**:
    - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
    - Train a Linear Regression model on the training set.
    - Evaluate the model on the testing set.

4. **Prediction**:
    - Use the trained model to predict house prices for new data.

## Data Preprocessing

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, removed outliers, and ensured data consistency.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features and transformed existing ones to improve model performance.
- **Normalization**: Applied normalization techniques to scale the data for better model convergence.

## Model Building

- **Linear Regression**: Built and trained a Linear Regression model to predict house prices.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluated the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).

## Results

- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test dataset.
- **Key Insights**: Identified the most significant factors influencing house prices, such as square footage and the number of bathrooms.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable experience in developing a predictive model using Linear Regression. The skills gained in data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation will be applicable in future machine learning projects.

## Future Work

- **Model Improvement**: Explore other regression techniques such as Ridge or Lasso to improve accuracy.
- **Feature Expansion**: Include additional features like location, property age, and neighborhood amenities.
- **User Interface**: Develop a web application to allow users to input data and get real-time price predictions.
